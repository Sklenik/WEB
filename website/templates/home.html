      I am an ambitious beginner programmer who loves learning new things and

      I am good with python and I also know some HTML and CSS, both of whitch I
      picked up while making this website. Honorable mentions of my other
      programming knowledge are node.js and working with gamemaker studio,
      although I am not using neither of them right now. Sklenik is my nick,
      derived from my surname.
